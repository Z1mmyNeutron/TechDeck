                <p>In today's world, we are often told that art and science are at a polarity from each other. That they are two ends of a spectrum, and while I understand the concept, I think of them as completely intertwined. There is an art in breaking down the world so perfectly and methodically that concrete conclusions can be drawn from natural phenomenon. And there is a beauty that comes from advancing technique, learning to use new tools and expanding ones take on a medium. I love to push the boundaries of where art becomes science and science becoming art, because when they become intertwined, well, that's where the real magic happens. </p>
